<li>Python是一门高级计算机编程语言，简单易用。</li>
<li>Python的哲学就是 <strong>简单优雅</strong>。Python为我们提供了非常完善的基础代码库，例如：网络、文件、GUI、数据库等大量内容，而且还有极其丰富的第三方库，使用极其方便、<strong>不用重复造轮子</strong>。国内外许多大型网站都是用Python写的，比如YouTube、Instagram、豆瓣等等，Google也在大量的使用此语言。</li>

<h2 id="4-字符串和编码"><a href="#4-字符串和编码" class="headerlink" title="4. 字符串和编码"></a>4. 字符串和编码</h2><p>计算机是美国🇺🇸发明的，因此最开始的ASCII码只有127个字符字母被编辑到计算机内(大小写字母、标点符号等)。后来各个国家也加入了自己语言的相应编码，例如：中国(GB2312)、日本(Shift_JIS)等，这样一来各个国家的编码会出现不可避免的冲突，在一些有各个国家语言的文本里，就会出现乱码显示。<br>因此Unicode油然而生，他将所有的语言都统一到了一种编码方式中。ASCII编码常用1个字节，Unicode常用2个字节。这样新的问题就诞生了，如果全是英文的文本中，文本所占用的空间就会比原本的多两倍。因此后来又诞生了可变长度的：UTF-8。<br>计算机系统通用的字符编码方式：在计算机内存中，使用Unicode的编码方式，在保存到硬盘或者传输的过程中，使用UTF-8。<br>UTF-8 的一个缺点：计算字符串长度和查找子字符串非常没效率。</p>
<ul>
<li>使用记事本：用记事本编辑的时候，从文件读取的UTF-8字符被转换为Unicode字符到内存里，编辑完成后，保存的时候再把Unicode转换为UTF-8保存到文件。</li>
<li>浏览网页：服务器会把动态生成的Unicode内容转换为UTF-8再传输到浏览器。网页的源码上会有类似<meta charset="UTF-8">的信息，表示该网页正是用的UTF-8编码。</li>

<ul>
<li>Having a topic for your project is just the starting point. You must also be able to define the aim of your project. In other words: <strong>‘What do I want to know?’</strong></li>

<ul>
<li>Objectives: (How am I going to find that out?)<br>The objectives can be considered as <strong>tactical statements</strong> that, in the light of constraints, translate the aims into inter-related yet self-sufficient coherent statements of what the researcher hopes to achieve. Objectives specify <strong>what will be known at the end of the project</strong> that isn’t known at its beginning and has been revealed by the research.</li>
<li>The objectives are usually the steps you will take to achieve your aim.<br>Your objectives often play a <strong>huge role</strong> in structuring your report and in determining what kind of sources you need!</li>

<li>Each philosophy makes assumptions about knowledge that will guide your research and lead you to use certain research methods e.g. interviews or questionnaires. This should result in a coherent piece of research.</li>
<li>As a researcher, you need to select an appropriate research philosophy to underpin your work and be aware of its strengths and weaknesses.</li>

Positivism</h3><p>“as an approach to social science develops from the traditions of the natural sciences. It is based on an ontological assumption that the world is governed by a series of rules and laws and an associated epistemological position that these rules can be tested and understood through experiments. Such a position therefore favours <strong><em>quantitative methods</em></strong>, as these are seen to be <strong><em>objective</em></strong>, and the results generalizable.”</p>

Instead, reality is seen as <strong><em>subjective</em></strong>, with people having varied experiences and perspectives, and thus interpretations of the social world. In order to understand the social world, we therefore need to understand and explain these varying experiences and perspectives. It follows, then, that we should adopt <strong><em>qualitative methods</em></strong> so as to understand the rich and complex lives and opinions of the people we are researching.”</p>
